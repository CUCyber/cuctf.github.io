  <h4 class="clemson-orange-text">Online update for Sponsors </h4>
      
        <p> With CUCTF 2020 switching to an online infrastructure, all Silver, Gold, and Diamond sponsors will: </p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>Be provided private online meeting lobbies to connect with students and present information about their organization</li>
          <li>Maintain sponsorship status into the CUCTF 2021 Event</li>
        </ul>
        <p> CU Cyber understands that interacting with students online does not match the value of meeting with students in person. To ensure that your donation gives you your full value, Silver, Gold, and Diamond sponsors will have the option to maintain their sponsor status at CUCTF 2021 with no extra cost! </p>
